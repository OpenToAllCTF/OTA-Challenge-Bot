## Retrieving the API token

Bot applications are not allowed to access all api methods from Slack. Thus, if
you create a bot integration on slack, the bot won't be able to create new
channels for example. To get around this restriction, you have to create a real
slack user and generate an authentication token for it, which can then be used
instead of a bot token.

1. Create a new user in slack (this will be the bot user, so give it an appropriate username)
2. Log into slack with this newly created user
3. Navigate to https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens
  * The user should show up there together with your slack workspace
5. Press "Create token"
  * This should create a token starting with "xoxp-"
7. Use this token as the `api_key` for the bot
8. Logout and login with your regular user again.

After restarting the bot, the bot user should now show up in your slack workspace.


## Installation

1. Copy `config.json.template` to `config.json`
2. Fill the API token and bot name in the config.json file.
3. Add your user id (slack id, not the username) to `admin_users` group in `config.json`
4. If you want to use the wolfram alpha api, register a valid app id on http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/ and set `wolfram_app_id` in `config.json`
5. Copy `intro_msg.template` to `intro_msg` and set a proper introduction message, which can be shown with `!intro`
6. `docker build -t ota-challenge-bot .`
7. `docker run -it --rm --name live-ota-challenge-bot ota-challenge-bot`


## Development

1. Copy `config.json.template` to `config.json`
2. Fill the API token and bot name in the config.json file.
3. Create a virtual env: `python3 -m venv .venv`
4. Enter the virtual env: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Using git support for uploading solve updates

1. Copy `config_solvetracker.json.template` to `config_solvetracker.json`.
2. Configure the git account, the local repo and the remote path, which should be used to access your git repository.

Example:
```
{
    "git_repopath" : "/home/ota_bot/OTA_Upload",
    "git_repouser" : "otabot",
    "git_repopass" : "password",
    "git_remoteuri" : "github.com/ota_bot/OTA_Upload.git",
    "git_branch" : "master",
    "git_baseurl" : "https://ota.github.io/SolveTracker"
}
```

3. Update the templates in `templates` according to your preferences (or go with the default ones).
4. Make sure that there's a `_posts` and `_stats` folder in your git repository.
4. You should be good to go now and git support should be active on the next startup. You can now use the `postsolves` command to push blog posts with the current solve status to git.
