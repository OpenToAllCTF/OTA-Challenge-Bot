```


## Installation

1. Copy `config.json.template` to `config.json`
2. Fill the API token and bot name in the config.json file.
3. Add your user id (slack id, not the username) to `admin_users` group in `config.json`
4. If you want to use the wolfram alpha api, register a valid app id on http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/ and set `wolfram_app_id` in `config.json`
5. Copy `intro_msg.template` to `intro_msg` and set a proper introduction message, which can be shown with `!intro`
6. `docker build -t ota-challenge-bot .`
7. `docker run -it --rm --name live-ota-challenge-bot ota-challenge-bot`


## Development

1. Copy `config.json.template` to `config.json`
2. Fill the API token and bot name in the config.json file.
3. Create a virtual env: `python3 -m venv .venv`
4. Enter the virtual env: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Using git support for uploading solve updates

1. Copy `config_solvetracker.json.template` to `config_solvetracker.json`.
2. Configure the git account, the local repo and the remote path, which should be used to access your git repository.

Example:
```
{
    "git_repopath" : "/home/ota_bot/OTA_Upload",
    "git_repouser" : "otabot",
    "git_repopass" : "password",
    "git_remoteuri" : "github.com/ota_bot/OTA_Upload.git",
    "git_branch" : "master",
    "git_baseurl" : "https://ota.github.io/SolveTracker"
}
```

3. Update the templates in `templates` according to your preferences (or go with the default ones).
4. Make sure that there's a `_posts` and `_stats` folder in your git repository.
4. You should be good to go now and git support should be active on the next startup. You can now use the `postsolves` command to push blog posts with the current solve status to git.


## Usage for irc bridges

The irc handler supports bridges for multiple irc servers and channels. When an irc bridge is started, it will read
from the irc channel and post the messages to the slack channel, in which it was created.

1. Edit irc_config.json to change the behaviour of the irc bridges

`use_message_queue`: Enable message queuing for pushing messages to slack to avoid hitting the slack api rate limit.
`message_queue_interval`: Interval, in which messages from the queue will be posted to the slack server
`irc_process_interval`: Update interval, in which irc messages will be read

2. Register irc servers and bridges

Before a bridge can be used, the corresponding server must be registered and the bridge must be added to that server.
```
!addserver freenode irc.freenode.org
!addirc freenode ctfbridge ctfchannel
```
The bot will remember the servers and bridges until you remove them explicitly.
```
!rmirc freenode ctfbridge
!rmserver freenode
```
To activate an irc bridge, the server must be connected first.
```
!startserver freenode
!startirc freenode ctfbridge (start when server finished connecting.)
```
After this, the bridge will update the slack channel whenever new messages from irc arrives (and the message queue got
triggered).

If the irc channel gets to spammy, every bridge can be disconnected separately.
```
!stopirc freenode ctfbridge
```
or a complete irc server can be stopped (which will also leave all irc channels)
```
!stopserver freenode
```
